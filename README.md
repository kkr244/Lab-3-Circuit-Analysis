# Lab-3-Circuit-Analysis
# By: Courtney Conklin, Kennedy Krieg, Payton Suellentrop 
# Summary 
For this lab, the first goal is to use Partsim, a simulation software, to verify Kirchhoff's voltage and Kirchhoff's current law. The online software allowed us to create the given circuits that were built on the breadboards in lab on the software  and compare the theorectical current and voltageto the measured current and voltage. The second objective for this lab is to apply the superposition and Thevenin's theorems to anaylize different electrical circuits while also confirming the validity of these theorems. 
# Materials
- Computer with Partsim software and TinkerCAD circuits software
- Breadboard 
- DC power supply 
- Resistors of the following values: 1kOhms, 2.2kOhms, 5.1kOhms, 4.7kOhms, 220kOhms, 6.8kOhms, 10kOhms, 3.3kOhms, 470kOhms
# Assembly Procedure
Part 1: Series Circuit
1. Follow the schematic that corresponds part one on the lab manual and build the circuit on the breadboard using the correct resistors and 10 volts on the DC power supply. 
2. Build the circuit in the simulation software. 

Part 2: Parallel Circuit 
1. Build the specified circuit from the lab manual on the bread board using the correct voltage and resistors. 
2. Repeat by building the circuit in the simulation software. 

Part 3: Potentiometer
1. Do the following calculations to answer the following question: Given a sensor that ranges from 0-19.650K Ohms and a 14.1V input voltage, determine the correct resistance (R?) to place in series with the sensor to yield a voltage output between 0-5V across the sensor.

Part 4: TinkerCAD Cirucits 
1. Login to TinkerCAD Circuits 
2. Start a simulation and in the components drop down part, swtich to starts, then Arduino, and then select blink. 
3. Find and run the starter Analog Input. 

# Test Equipment 
- Fluke, the multimeter, to measure the voltage drop across each resistor in the parallel circuit and series circuit. The multimeter was not used to measure current to prevent more fuses from being blown, but the current was measured on the simulation software. 
# Test Procedure 
Part 1: Series Circuit 
1. Using the voltage probes and setting the units on the multimeter to volts, mmeasure the voltage drop for each resistor in the circuit. 
2. Measure the voltage for each resistor in the circuit on the simulation software. 
3. Do not use the current probes to measure the current in the circuit, only use the simulation to determine the current.
4. Record all the values in a table.

Part 2: Parallel Circuit 
1. Look at the simulation software and determine current I1-I7 from the circuit. 
2. Use the multimeter to measure the voltage drop across resistors R1-R8 and record in a table. 
3. Use the circuit in the simulation softwaree to determine the simulated voltage drop across each resistor. 

Part 3: 
1. Determine the correct resistance to place in series with a sensor that ranges from 0-19.650 kOhms and a 14.1 V input voltage to yield a voltage output between 0-5 V across the sensor. 

Part 4: 
1. Login to TinkerCAD Circuit. 
2. Run the start Analog Input.
